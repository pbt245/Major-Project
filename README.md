## SHERLOCK
### A STUDY IN PINK

This assignment is based on episode 1 season 1 of a TV series on BBC named Sherlock. This
series is a British mystery crime drama television series based on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s
Sherlock Holmes detective stories.

John Watson is a military medic resting in London after being wounded in Afghanistan. He
was thinking about changing to another apartment with a lower rent when he accidentally met
an old friend. Watson was then introduced to Sherlock Holmes by that friend to share a room
at 221B Baker Street, owned by Mrs. Hudson. From there, Watson was drawn into Sherlock’s
challenging cases, and Sherlock had a new companion in his quest to solve the case.

The most recent case was of a woman in a pink dress. This case is different from previous
cases in that: the victim scratched the floor with her fingernails and left a message. The results
of the scene investigation showed that the victim lost her luggage. With Sherlock’s talent, he
found the lost luggage. Thereby, he took it to room 221B Baker Street and looked for further
traces of the criminal. Watson also returns at the same time and joins Sherlock.
